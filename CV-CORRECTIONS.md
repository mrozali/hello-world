# CV Corrections Guide

## Critical Fixes (Must Fix)

### 1. Publications Record Date (Page ~21)
**Location:** Publications Record section header
**Current:** `Date: March 22, 2014`
**Change to:** `Date: 3 April 2025` (or current date to match main CV header)

---

### 2. Name Spelling Error - Graduate Students Table
**Location:** Section 8(b), Graduate Students table, MSc entry for Wyatt
**Current:** `Wyatt Reevs` (MSc, 2017-2018)
**Change to:** `Wyatt Reeves`

---

### 3. Typo in Invited Presentations Table
**Location:** Invited Presentations table, July 2025 entry (Nadal, Brazil)
**Current:** `Randomness if CFTs`
**Change to:** `Randomness in CFTs`

---

## Table Formatting Fixes

### 4. Employment at UBC Table (Section 6b)
**Location:** Section 6(b) "At UBC" table
**Issue:** Professor row is split incorrectly across two rows
**Current:**
```
|Professor                        |                                 |
|                                 |Since 2013                       |
```
**Change to:**
```
|Professor                        |Since 2013                       |
```
(Merge into single row with "Professor" in first column and "Since 2013" in second column)

---

### 5. Incomplete Conference Entry
**Location:** Conference Participation table, near the end (after July 2025 Brazil entry)
**Issue:** Orphaned row with only `Cologne, Germany` and empty date/name columns
**Fix:** Either complete this entry with proper date and conference name, or remove if duplicate (there's already a December 2025 Cologne entry in Invited Presentations)

---

## Formatting Consistency Fixes

### 6. Course Names List (Section 8)
**Location:** After the teaching courses table, the parenthetical course names explanation
**Current:** Mixed formats like `Physics 170`, `Phys 203`, `Phys216-`
**Change to:** Consistent format with space before hyphen:
- `Physics 170 - Mechanics` OR `Phys 170 - Mechanics` (pick one style)
- `Phys 216 - Mechanics` (add space before hyphen)
- Apply same format to all course names

---

### 7. Location Spelling - Newe/Neve Shalom
**Location:** Multiple places in Invited Presentations
**Issue:** Inconsistent spelling
**Current:** Both `Neve Shalom` and `Newe Shalom` are used
**Change to:** Pick one spelling and use consistently (recommend `Neve Shalom`)
**Occurrences to check:**
- April 2019 entry
- All Israel joint theory seminar entries

---

### 8. Postdoc List Date Spacing
**Location:** Section 8, Postdoctoral Fellows list (2020-2024 entries)
**Current:** Some entries have `(2020- 2023)` with extra space after hyphen
**Change to:** Remove extra spaces: `(2020-2023)`
**Affected entries:**
- Lampros Lamprou
- Arjun Kar
- Charles Marteau
- Aidan Chatwin-Davies (also fix hyphen: `Chatwin-Davies` not `Chatwin- Davies`)
- Felipe Rosso
- Panagiotis Betzios

---

### 9. Postdoc List Indentation
**Location:** Section 8, Postdoctoral Fellows list
**Issue:** Inconsistent left indentation - some names have leading spaces, others don't
**Fix:** Align all names to same left margin

---

### 10. Double Comma
**Location:** Invited Presentations table, June 2001 entry
**Current:** `KIAS,,Seoul, Korea`
**Change to:** `KIAS, Seoul, Korea`

---

## Minor Fixes

### 11. Bullet Point Character
**Location:** Section 6, after the UBC employment table
**Current:** Shows corrupted character before "Date of granting of tenure"
**Fix:** Replace with proper bullet point (bullet, dash, or asterisk)

---

### 12. Section 6 Labeling
**Location:** Section 6, Employment Record
**Issue:** Has "(b) At UBC" but no "(a)" label for "Prior to coming to UBC"
**Fix:** Either add "(a)" before "Prior to coming to UBC" OR remove "(b)" from "At UBC"

---

### 13. Institution Name Consistency (Optional)
**Location:** Education section vs Invited Presentations
**Issue:** `University of Texas` vs `University of Texas at Austin`
**Recommendation:** Use full name `University of Texas at Austin` in education section

---

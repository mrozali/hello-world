The subatomic section is unique in NSERC is assigning grants (including grant amounts) from a fixed envelope. The membership rotates every 3 years and includes, in addition to making grant decisions, membership in standing review committees for large facilities (e.g. TRIUMF or ATLAS Canada), and participation in departmental visits across Canada.

*(c) Reviewer (journal, agency, etc. including dates)*

Referee for various journals including for example: Physics Review, Nuclear Physics B, Journal of High Energy Physics, Journal of Canadian Physics, Classical and Quantum Gravity, and others.

### 12. AWARDS AND DISTINCTIONS

*(a) Awards for Teaching (indicate name of award, awarding organizations, date)*

*(b) Awards for Scholarship (indicate name of award, awarding organizations, date)*

First prize essay in the gravity foundation essay contest (with V. Balasubramanian and D. Marolf), April 2006.

The gravity research foundation maintains an annual contest for research essays on topics related to gravitational physics. The essays are received from all over the world and are judged by a committee of professional physicists. Past winners include Steven Hawking, Roger Penrose, Paul Steinhardt, Lawrence Krauss, Ilya Prigogine, A.M. Polyakov, and other prominent physicists.

Third prize essay in the FQXI essay competition, Spring 2011.

The Foundational Questions Institute maintains occasional contests for essays on the foundations of physics and related topics. The 2011 competition was titled "Is Reality Digital and Analogue" and drew a few hundred essays from around the world. The third prize is 2000 USD.
